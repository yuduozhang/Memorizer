Memorizer
=========

Memorizer is a simple and effective command line tool that can help users study new languages more effectively. Users are able to put   entries into the review book, and then Memorizer will compute their next reviewing time according to the   Forgetting Curve and usersâ€™ familiarity of them. If some entries hit the reviewing time, Memorizer will   remind users to review them.

I wrote this 2 years ago, so the code is pretty naive but it works effectively. I have been using it to memorize for all my Japanese exams.
