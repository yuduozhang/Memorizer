Memorizer
=========

Memorizer is a simple and effective command line tool that can help users study new languages more effectively. Users are able to put   entries into the Study Bank, and then Memorizer will compute their next reviewing time according to the   Forgetting Curve and usersâ€™ familiarity of them. If some entries hit the reviewing time, Memorizer will   remind users to review them.
